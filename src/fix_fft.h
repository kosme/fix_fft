  fix_fftr() - forward/inverse FFT on array of real numbers.
  Real FFT/iFFT using half-size complex FFT by distributing
  even/odd samples into real/imaginary arrays respectively.
  In order to save data space (i.e. to avoid two arrays, one
  for real, one for imaginary samples), we proceed in the
  following two steps: a) samples are rearranged in the real
  array so that all even samples are in places 0-(N/2-1) and
  all imaginary samples in places (N/2)-(N-1), and b) fix_fft
  is called with fr and fi pointing to index 0 and index N/2
  respectively in the original array. The above guarantees
  that fix_fft "sees" consecutive real samples as alternating
  real and imaginary samples in the complex array.
